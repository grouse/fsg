<p>Design is design.</p>

<p>The only difference between an application's graphical user interface and a programmer's application interface is that in one the user presses buttons and keys with their mouse and keyboard to interact with the program, and in the other the user presses buttons and keys with their mouse and keyboard to interact with the text editor, which is a program. That is to say, there are a lot fewer differences than there are similarities.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most concrete actual difference lies in that whereas a user interacts with the interface of a program to achieve some task, a programmer interacts with the API to create the program, which is to achieve some task.</p>

<p>I'm not just saying this to be pedantic. I think a lot of us, programmers, have a tendency to distance ourselves from GUI design with the excuse that we're not GUI designers. My point in pointing this out is that actually, we've got a lot in common. When a programmer is designing an API to be used by other programmers they share much of the concerns and best practices with that of other designers. Because fundamentally, design is design. And design is about providing an interface for some interaction. Good design makes that interaction an empowering experience.</p>

<p>Realising this opens up a metric ton of literature of design. It turns out, designers have existed for a very long time, and some of them are far older than computers. We can learn a thing or two by studying them.</p>
