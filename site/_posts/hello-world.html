<p>Just like every blog needs a "Hello World" post to start things off, so does this one. And just like every introductionary post promising times of grandeur, interesting content providing food for thought, and frequent updates, just to fall into obscurity with no update in sight for months, this one is no exception.</p>

<!-- fsg: brief; -->

<p>My name's Jesper Stefansson. I'm an aspiring game developer from Sweden currently employed by Feral Interactive to port video games to Linux. At the time of writing this employment has resulted in primary involvement in the Linux ports Tomb Raider, the 2013 reboot, and Total War: WARHAMMER.</p>

<p>So what's with the blog? Well, I've always quite enjoyed writing, and over the years I've deluded myself into thinking I'm rather decent at it. And what better way to share in the insanity that is every day life as a game developer, as my hair grows greyer and my mind ever more cynical.</p>

<p>As alluded to by the start of this post, I have a few ideas and rough notes for a few topics I wish to write about. I also have far too many books to read, and code to code, so we'll see what happens. Don't hold your breath.</p>

<p>Until next time,<br/>Jesper</p>
